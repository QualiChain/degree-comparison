# degree-comparison

The Degree Comparison tool defined in task T4.2.

For now it includes:
- a schema that defines the format of the degrees to be compared (degree.schema.json)
- a very simple example, not a full degree, just to help understand the schema (simple-example.json)
- the definition of a set of real IST degrees (ist*.json)

The real degrees can be compared among themselves. A quick inspection shows that some are related, whereas others are not.
